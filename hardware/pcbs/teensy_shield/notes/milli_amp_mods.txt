+/- 12mA range:
----------------
    
    R8 -> 50 Ohm, Digikey P49.9DACT-ND

    Works great over full range


+/- 40mA range:
----------------

    R7 -> 15 Ohm, Digikey A103157CT-ND
    
    OK between about -20mA and 20mA.  Fails outside of this range.  Issues
    seems to be with transimpedance amplifier - unable to source/sink enough
    current.

+/- 24mA  range:
-----------------

    R7 -> 24 Ohm,  2x 50 Ohm Digikey P49.9DACT-ND in parallel.
