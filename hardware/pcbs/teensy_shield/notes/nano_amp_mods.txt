Notes of prototype withe nano amp range modifications

Initial version
----------------

1. Modified resistor R5 to be 6.04 MOhm w/ C19 a 10nF capacitor.

2. Modified resistor R6 to 10 MOhm w/ C20 a 10nF capacitor. 


Second version  
---------------

1. R5 = 6.04 MOhm, C19 = 10nF capacitor    (100nF range)

2. R6 = 10 MOhm,  C20 =  100nF (60nF range)

Note, larger cap is used on C20 as 60nA range unstable when connected to
sensor.
